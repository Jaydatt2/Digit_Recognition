# Digit_Recognition
**Digit Recognition** is a machine learning application that identifies handwritten digits (0-9). Using datasets like MNIST, it processes 28x28 grayscale pixel images. Algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) analyze patterns, enabling accurate recognition. Applications include postal systems, bank checks, and AI-based automation.
